## BackGround
The idea started with what people remember, the purpose of not forgetting it.<br>
Next, we thought of a number of ways, such as an alarm to notify you when a person makes a reservation, a special notepad, etc., but as a result, we made the game the most interesting and familiar to us.<br>
## Description

Several *folders* will appear.<br>
