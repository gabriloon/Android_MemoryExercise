## BackGround
The idea started with what people remember, the purpose of not forgetting it.<br>
Next, we thought of a number of ways, such as an alarm to notify you when a person makes a reservation, a special notepad, etc., but as a result, we made the game the most interesting and familiar to us.<br>
## Description
The overall game is divided into a short-term memory improvement game and a long-term memory improvement game.<br>
There is one game in the long-term memory improvement game.<br>
There are 6 different types of games in the short-term memory improvement game.<br>
Each game has a level of difficulty, and each level of difficulty is set differently.<br>
In **/layout**, the UI, that is, the in-game screen was configured.<br>
